# STL Decomposition: Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS

Performs STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS) on
functional data following Cleveland et al. (1990). This is a robust
iterative procedure that separates a time series into trend, seasonal,
and remainder components.

## Usage

``` r
stl.fd(fdataobj, period, s.window = NULL, t.window = NULL, robust = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- fdataobj:

  An fdata object.

- period:

  Integer. The seasonal period (number of observations per cycle).

- s.window:

  Seasonal smoothing window. Must be odd. If NULL, defaults to 7. Larger
  values produce smoother seasonal components.

- t.window:

  Trend smoothing window. Must be odd. If NULL, automatically calculated
  based on period and s.window.

- robust:

  Logical. If TRUE, performs robustness iterations to downweight
  outliers using bisquare weighting. Default: TRUE.

## Value

A list of class "stl_result" with components:

- trend:

  fdata object containing trend components

- seasonal:

  fdata object containing seasonal components

- remainder:

  fdata object containing remainder (residual) components

- weights:

  Matrix of robustness weights (1 = full weight, 0 = outlier)

- period:

  The period used

- s.window:

  Seasonal smoothing window used

- t.window:

  Trend smoothing window used

- inner.iterations:

  Number of inner loop iterations

- outer.iterations:

  Number of outer (robustness) iterations

- call:

  The function call

## Details

The STL algorithm proceeds as follows:

**Inner Loop** (repeated n.inner times):

1.  Detrending: Subtract current trend estimate

2.  Cycle-subseries smoothing: Smooth values at each seasonal position
    across cycles

3.  Low-pass filtering: Remove high-frequency noise

4.  Detrending the smoothed cycle-subseries

5.  Deseasonalizing: Subtract seasonal from original data

6.  Trend smoothing: Apply LOESS to deseasonalized data

**Outer Loop** (for robustness):

1.  Compute residuals from current decomposition

2.  Calculate robustness weights using bisquare function

3.  Re-run inner loop with weighted smoothing

STL is particularly effective for:

- Long time series with many cycles

- Data with outliers (when robust=TRUE)

- Slowly changing seasonal patterns

## Examples

``` r
# Create seasonal data with trend
t <- seq(0, 20, length.out = 400)
period <- 2  # corresponds to 40 observations
period_obs <- 40
X <- matrix(0.05 * t + sin(2 * pi * t / period) + rnorm(length(t), sd = 0.2), nrow = 1)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)

# Perform STL decomposition
result <- stl.fd(fd, period = period_obs)
print(result)
#> STL Decomposition
#> -----------------
#> Period:           40 observations
#> Seasonal window:  7
#> Trend window:     77
#> Inner iterations: 2
#> Outer iterations: 15 (robust=TRUE)
#> 
#> Number of curves: 1
#> Series length:    400
#> 
#> Variance decomposition:
#>   Trend:     11.9%
#>   Seasonal:  82.7%
#>   Remainder: 5.3%

# Plot the decomposition
plot(result)


# Non-robust version (faster but sensitive to outliers)
result_fast <- stl.fd(fd, period = period_obs, robust = FALSE)
```
