# Plot FPCA Results

Visualize functional principal component analysis results with multiple
plot types: component perturbation plots, variance explained (scree
plot), or score plots.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'fdata2pc'
plot(
  x,
  type = c("components", "variance", "scores"),
  ncomp = 3,
  multiple = 2,
  show_both_directions = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An object of class 'fdata2pc' from
  [`fdata2pc`](https://sipemu.github.io/fdars-r/reference/fdata2pc.md).

- type:

  Type of plot: "components" (default) shows mean +/- scaled PC
  loadings, "variance" shows a scree plot of variance explained,
  "scores" shows PC1 vs PC2 scatter plot of observations.

- ncomp:

  Number of components to display (default 3 or fewer if not available).

- multiple:

  Factor for scaling PC perturbations. Default is 2 (shows +/-
  2\*sqrt(eigenvalue)\*PC).

- show_both_directions:

  Logical. If TRUE (default), show both positive and negative
  perturbations (mean + PC and mean - PC). If FALSE, only show positive
  perturbation. All curves are solid lines differentiated by color.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to plotting functions.

## Value

A ggplot object (invisibly).

## Details

The "components" plot shows the mean function (black) with perturbations
in the direction of each principal component. The perturbation is
computed as: mean +/- multiple \* sqrt(variance_explained) \*
PC_loading. All lines are solid and differentiated by color only.

The "variance" plot shows a scree plot with the proportion of variance
explained by each component as a bar chart.

The "scores" plot shows a scatter plot of observations in PC space,
typically PC1 vs PC2.

## Examples

``` r
t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 50)
X <- matrix(0, 30, 50)
for (i in 1:30) X[i, ] <- sin(2*pi*t + runif(1, 0, pi)) + rnorm(50, sd = 0.1)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)
pc <- fdata2pc(fd, ncomp = 3)

# Plot PC components (mean +/- perturbations)
plot(pc, type = "components")


# Scree plot
plot(pc, type = "variance")


# Score plot
plot(pc, type = "scores")
```
