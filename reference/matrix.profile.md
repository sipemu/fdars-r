# Matrix Profile for Motif Discovery and Period Detection

Computes the Matrix Profile using the STOMP (Scalable Time series
Ordered-search Matrix Profile) algorithm. The Matrix Profile stores the
z-normalized Euclidean distance between each subsequence and its nearest
neighbor, enabling efficient motif discovery and period detection for
non-sinusoidal patterns.

## Usage

``` r
matrix.profile(fdataobj, subsequence_length = NULL, exclusion_zone = 0.5)
```

## Arguments

- fdataobj:

  An fdata object.

- subsequence_length:

  Length of subsequences to compare. If NULL, automatically determined
  as approximately 1/4 of series length.

- exclusion_zone:

  Fraction of subsequence length to exclude around each position to
  prevent trivial self-matches. Default: 0.5.

## Value

A list of class "matrix_profile_result" with components:

- profile:

  Numeric vector of minimum z-normalized distances at each position

- profile_index:

  Integer vector of nearest neighbor indices (1-based)

- subsequence_length:

  Subsequence length used

- detected_periods:

  Candidate periods detected from arc analysis (top 5)

- arc_counts:

  Arc counts at each index distance (for diagnostics)

- primary_period:

  Most prominent detected period

- confidence:

  Confidence score (0-1) based on arc prominence

## Details

The Matrix Profile algorithm (Yeh et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016) is
particularly suited for:

- Non-sinusoidal repeating patterns (unlike FFT/spectral methods)

- Motif discovery (finding repeated subsequences)

- Anomaly detection (subsequences with no good match)

The STOMP variant uses O(n^2) time complexity but is highly
cache-efficient. For very long series (\>10000 points), consider
downsampling.

Period detection is based on "arc analysis": counting how often the
nearest neighbor is a fixed distance away. Peaks in arc counts indicate
periodicity.

## Examples

``` r
# Periodic sawtooth wave (non-sinusoidal)
t <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 200)
period <- 2
X <- matrix((t %% period) / period, nrow = 1)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)

# Compute Matrix Profile
result <- matrix.profile(fd, subsequence_length = 30)
print(result)
