\title{Compute functional derivative}
\usage{
deriv(
  fdataobj,
  nderiv = 1,
  method = "diff",
  class.out = "fdata",
  nbasis = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fdataobj}{An object of class 'fdata'.}

\item{nderiv}{Derivative order (1, 2, ...). Default is 1. For 2D data,
only first-order derivatives are currently supported.}

\item{method}{Method for computing derivatives. Currently only "diff"
(finite differences) is supported.}

\item{class.out}{Output class, either "fdata" or "fd". Default is "fdata".}

\item{nbasis}{Not used (for compatibility with fda.usc).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
For 1D data: an 'fdata' object containing the derivative values.
For 2D data: a list with components \code{ds}, \code{dt}, and \code{dsdt},
each an 'fdata' object containing the respective partial derivative.
}
\description{
Compute the numerical derivative of functional data. Uses finite differences
for fast computation via Rust.
}
\details{
For 1D functional data (curves), computes the nth derivative.
For 2D functional data (surfaces), computes partial derivatives:
\itemize{
\item \code{ds}: partial derivative with respect to s (first argument)
\item \code{dt}: partial derivative with respect to t (second argument)
\item \code{dsdt}: mixed partial derivative
}
}
\examples{
# Create smooth curves
t <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)
X <- matrix(0, 10, 100)
for (i in 1:10) X[i, ] <- sin(t + i/5)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)

# First derivative (should be approximately cos)
fd_deriv <- deriv(fd, nderiv = 1)
