\title{Analyze Peak Timing Variability}
\usage{
analyze.peak.timing(fdataobj, period, smooth_nbasis = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fdataobj}{An fdata object.}

\item{period}{Known period (e.g., 365 for daily data with yearly seasonality).}

\item{smooth_nbasis}{Number of Fourier basis functions for smoothing.
If NULL, uses GCV for automatic selection (range 5-25). Default: NULL.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{peak_times}{Vector of peak times}
\item{peak_values}{Vector of peak values}
\item{normalized_timing}{Position within cycle (0-1 scale)}
\item{mean_timing}{Mean normalized timing}
\item{std_timing}{Standard deviation of normalized timing}
\item{range_timing}{Range of normalized timing (max - min)}
\item{variability_score}{Variability score (0 = stable, 1 = highly variable)}
\item{timing_trend}{Linear trend in timing (positive = peaks getting later)}
\item{cycle_indices}{Cycle indices (1-indexed)}
}
}
\description{
For short series (e.g., 3-5 years of yearly data), this function detects
one peak per cycle and analyzes how peak timing varies between cycles.
Uses Fourier basis smoothing for peak detection.
}
\details{
The variability score is computed as std_timing / 0.1, capped at 1.
A score > 0.5 suggests peaks are shifting substantially between cycles.
The timing_trend indicates if peaks are systematically moving earlier
or later over time.

Fourier basis smoothing is ideal for seasonal signals because it naturally
captures periodic patterns.

\examples{
# 5 years of yearly data where peak shifts
t <- seq(0, 5, length.out = 365 * 5)
periods <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)  # 5 complete years
# Peaks shift: March (0.2), April (0.3), May (0.4), April (0.3), March (0.2)
peak_phases <- c(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2)
X <- sin(2 * pi * t + rep(peak_phases, each = 365))
fd <- fdata(matrix(X, nrow = 1), argvals = t)

result <- analyze.peak.timing(fd, period = 1)
print(result$variability_score)  # Shows timing variability
