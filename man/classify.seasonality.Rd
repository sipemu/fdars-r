\title{Classify Seasonality Type}
\usage{
classify.seasonality(
  fdataobj,
  period,
  strength_threshold = NULL,
  timing_threshold = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fdataobj}{An fdata object.}

\item{period}{Known seasonal period.}

\item{strength_threshold}{Threshold for seasonal/non-seasonal (default: 0.3).}

\item{timing_threshold}{Max std of normalized timing for "stable" (default: 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{is_seasonal}{Logical: is the series seasonal overall?}
\item{has_stable_timing}{Logical: is peak timing stable across cycles?}
\item{timing_variability}{Timing variability score (0-1)}
\item{seasonal_strength}{Overall seasonal strength}
\item{cycle_strengths}{Per-cycle seasonal strength}
\item{weak_seasons}{Indices of weak/missing seasons (0-indexed)}
\item{classification}{One of: "StableSeasonal", "VariableTiming",
"IntermittentSeasonal", "NonSeasonal"}
\item{peak_timing}{Peak timing analysis (if peaks detected)}
}
}
\description{
Classifies the type of seasonality in functional data. Particularly useful
for short series (3-5 years) to identify stable vs variable timing patterns.
}
\details{
Classification types:
\itemize{
\item StableSeasonal: Regular peaks with consistent timing
\item VariableTiming: Regular peaks but timing shifts between cycles
\item IntermittentSeasonal: Some cycles seasonal, some not
\item NonSeasonal: No clear seasonality
}
}
\examples{
# Pure seasonal signal
t <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 500)
X <- matrix(sin(2 * pi * t / 2), nrow = 1)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)

result <- classify.seasonality(fd, period = 2)
print(result$classification)  # "StableSeasonal"
}
