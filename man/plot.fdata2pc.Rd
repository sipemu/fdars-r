\usage{
\method{plot}{fdata2pc}(
  x,
  type = c("components", "variance", "scores"),
  ncomp = 3,
  multiple = 2,
  show_both_directions = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'fdata2pc' from \code{\link{fdata2pc}}.}

\item{type}{Type of plot: "components" (default) shows mean +/- scaled PC loadings,
"variance" shows a scree plot of variance explained, "scores" shows PC1 vs PC2
scatter plot of observations.}

\item{ncomp}{Number of components to display (default 3 or fewer if not available).}

\item{multiple}{Factor for scaling PC perturbations. Default is 2 (shows +/- 2*sqrt(eigenvalue)*PC).}

\item{show_both_directions}{Logical. If TRUE (default), show both positive and
negative perturbations (mean + PC and mean - PC). If FALSE, only show positive
perturbation. All curves are solid lines differentiated by color.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (invisibly).
}
\description{
Visualize functional principal component analysis results with multiple
plot types: component perturbation plots, variance explained (scree plot),
or score plots.
}
\details{
The "components" plot shows the mean function (black) with perturbations
in the direction of each principal component. The perturbation is computed as:
mean +/- multiple * sqrt(variance_explained) * PC_loading. All lines are solid
and differentiated by color only.

The "variance" plot shows a scree plot with the proportion of variance
explained by each component as a bar chart.

The "scores" plot shows a scatter plot of observations in PC space,
typically PC1 vs PC2.

\examples{
t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 50)
X <- matrix(0, 30, 50)
for (i in 1:30) X[i, ] <- sin(2*pi*t + runif(1, 0, pi)) + rnorm(50, sd = 0.1)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)
pc <- fdata2pc(fd, ncomp = 3)

# Plot PC components (mean +/- perturbations)
plot(pc, type = "components")

# Scree plot
plot(pc, type = "variance")

# Score plot
plot(pc, type = "scores")
