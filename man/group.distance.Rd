\title{Compute Distance/Similarity Between Groups of Functional Data}
\usage{
group.distance(
  fdataobj,
  groups,
  method = c("centroid", "hausdorff", "depth", "all"),
  metric = "lp",
  p = 2,
  depth.method = "FM",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fdataobj}{An object of class 'fdata'.}

\item{groups}{A factor or character vector specifying group membership for each curve.
Must have length equal to the number of curves.}

\item{method}{Distance/similarity method:
\itemize{
\item "centroid": L2 distance between group mean curves
\item "hausdorff": Hausdorff-style distance between groups
\item "depth": Depth-based overlap (similarity, not distance)
\item "all": Compute all methods
}}

\item{metric}{Distance metric for centroid method (default "lp").}

\item{p}{Power for Lp metric (default 2 for L2).}

\item{depth.method}{Depth method for depth-based overlap (default "FM").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to metric functions.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'group.distance' containing:
\describe{
\item{centroid}{Centroid distance matrix (if method includes centroid)}
\item{hausdorff}{Hausdorff distance matrix (if method includes hausdorff)}
\item{depth}{Depth-based similarity matrix (if method includes depth)}
\item{groups}{Unique group labels}
\item{group.sizes}{Number of curves per group}
\item{method}{Methods used}
}
}
\description{
Computes various distance and similarity measures between pre-defined groups
of functional curves.
}
\examples{
# Create grouped functional data
set.seed(42)
n <- 30
m <- 50
t_grid <- seq(0, 1, length.out = m)
X <- matrix(0, n, m)
for (i in 1:15) X[i, ] <- sin(2 * pi * t_grid) + rnorm(m, sd = 0.1)
for (i in 16:30) X[i, ] <- cos(2 * pi * t_grid) + rnorm(m, sd = 0.1)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t_grid)
groups <- factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 15))

# Compute all distance measures
gd <- group.distance(fd, groups, method = "all")
