\title{Semi-metric based on Fourier Coefficients (FFT)}
\usage{
semimetric.fourier(fdataobj, fdataref = NULL, nfreq = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fdataobj}{An object of class 'fdata'.}

\item{fdataref}{An object of class 'fdata'. If NULL, uses fdataobj.}

\item{nfreq}{Number of Fourier frequencies to use (excluding DC). Default is 5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
A distance matrix based on Fourier coefficients.
}
\description{
Computes a semi-metric based on the L2 distance of Fourier coefficients
computed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This is more efficient than
the Fourier basis option in semimetric.basis for large nfreq.
}
\details{
The Fourier coefficients are computed using FFT and normalized by the
number of points. The distance is the L2 distance between the magnitude
of the first nfreq+1 coefficients (DC + nfreq frequencies).

This function uses Rust's rustfft library for efficient FFT computation,
making it faster than R's base fft for large datasets.

\examples{
# Create curves with different frequency content
t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)
X <- matrix(0, 10, 100)
for (i in 1:10) X[i, ] <- sin(2*pi*i*t) + rnorm(100, sd = 0.1)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)

# Compute distance based on Fourier coefficients
D <- semimetric.fourier(fd, nfreq = 10)
