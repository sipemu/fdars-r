\title{Fuzzy C-Means Clustering for Functional Data}
\usage{
cluster.fcm(fdataobj, ncl, m = 2, max.iter = 100, tol = 1e-06, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fdataobj}{An object of class 'fdata'.}

\item{ncl}{Number of clusters.}

\item{m}{Fuzziness parameter (default 2). Must be > 1. Higher values give
softer cluster boundaries.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations (default 100).}

\item{tol}{Convergence tolerance (default 1e-6).}

\item{seed}{Optional random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A list of class 'fuzzycmeans.fd' with components:
\describe{
\item{membership}{Matrix of membership degrees (n x ncl). Each row sums to 1.}
\item{cluster}{Hard cluster assignments (argmax of membership).}
\item{centers}{An fdata object containing the cluster centers.}
\item{objective}{Final value of the objective function.}
\item{fdataobj}{The input functional data object.}
}
}
\description{
Performs fuzzy c-means clustering on functional data, where each curve has
a membership degree to each cluster rather than a hard assignment.
}
\details{
Fuzzy c-means minimizes the objective function:
\deqn{J = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{c=1}^k u_{ic}^m ||X_i - v_c||^2}
where u_ic is the membership of curve i in cluster c, v_c is the cluster
center, and m is the fuzziness parameter.

The membership degrees are updated as:
\deqn{u_{ic} = 1 / \sum_{j=1}^k (d_{ic}/d_{ij})^{2/(m-1)}}

When m approaches 1, FCM becomes equivalent to hard k-means.
As m increases, the clusters become softer (more overlap).
m = 2 is the most common choice.

\examples{
# Create functional data with THREE groups - one genuinely overlapping
set.seed(42)
t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 50)
n <- 45
X <- matrix(0, n, 50)

# Group 1: Sine waves centered at 0
for (i in 1:15) X[i, ] <- sin(2*pi*t) + rnorm(50, sd = 0.2)
# Group 2: Sine waves centered at 1.5 (clearly separated from group 1)
for (i in 16:30) X[i, ] <- sin(2*pi*t) + 1.5 + rnorm(50, sd = 0.2)
# Group 3: Between groups 1 and 2 (true overlap - ambiguous membership)
for (i in 31:45) X[i, ] <- sin(2*pi*t) + 0.75 + rnorm(50, sd = 0.3)

fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)

# Fuzzy clustering reveals the overlap
fcm <- cluster.fcm(fd, ncl = 3, seed = 123)

# Curves in group 3 (31-45) have split membership - this is the key benefit!
cat("Membership for curves 31-35 (overlap region):\n")
print(round(fcm$membership[31:35, ], 2))

# Compare to hard clustering which forces a decision
km <- cluster.kmeans(fd, ncl = 3, seed = 123)
cat("\nHard vs Fuzzy assignment for curve 35:\n")
cat("K-means cluster:", km$cluster[35], "\n")
cat("FCM memberships:", round(fcm$membership[35, ], 2), "\n")
