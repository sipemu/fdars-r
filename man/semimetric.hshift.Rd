\title{Semi-metric based on Horizontal Shift (Time Warping)}
\usage{
semimetric.hshift(fdataobj, fdataref = NULL, max_shift = -1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fdataobj}{An object of class 'fdata'.}

\item{fdataref}{An object of class 'fdata'. If NULL, uses fdataobj.}

\item{max_shift}{Maximum shift in number of grid points. Default is m/4
where m is the number of evaluation points. Use -1 for automatic.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
A distance matrix based on minimum L2 distance after shift.
}
\description{
Computes a semi-metric based on the minimum L2 distance after optimal
horizontal shifting of curves. This is useful for comparing curves that
may have phase differences.
}
\details{
For each pair of curves, this function computes:
\deqn{d(f, g) = \min_{|h| \le h_{max}} ||f(t) - g(t+h)||}
where h is the horizontal shift in discrete units.

This semi-metric is useful when comparing curves with phase shifts,
such as ECG signals with different heart rates or periodic signals
with different phases.
}
\examples{
# Create curves with phase shifts
t <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)
X <- matrix(0, 10, 100)
for (i in 1:10) X[i, ] <- sin(t + i*0.2) + rnorm(100, sd = 0.1)
fd <- fdata(X, argvals = t)

# Compute distance accounting for phase shifts
D <- semimetric.hshift(fd, max_shift = 10)
