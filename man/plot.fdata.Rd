\usage{
\method{plot}{fdata}(
  x,
  color = NULL,
  alpha = NULL,
  show.mean = FALSE,
  show.ci = FALSE,
  ci.level = 0.9,
  palette = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'fdata'.}

\item{color}{Optional vector for coloring curves. Can be:
\itemize{
\item Numeric vector: curves colored by continuous scale (viridis)
\item Factor/character: curves colored by discrete groups
}
Must have length equal to number of curves.}

\item{alpha}{Transparency of individual curve lines. Default is 0.7 for
basic plots, but automatically reduced to 0.3 when \code{show.mean = TRUE}
or \code{show.ci = TRUE} to reduce visual clutter and allow mean curves
to stand out. Can be explicitly set to override the default.}

\item{show.mean}{Logical. If TRUE and color is categorical, overlay group
mean curves with thicker lines (default FALSE).}

\item{show.ci}{Logical. If TRUE and color is categorical, show pointwise
confidence interval ribbons per group (default FALSE).}

\item{ci.level}{Confidence level for CI ribbons (default 0.90 for 90 percent).}

\item{palette}{Optional named vector of colors for categorical coloring,
e.g., c("A" = "blue", "B" = "red").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
The ggplot object (invisibly).
}
\description{
Displays a plot of functional data. For 1D functional data, plots curves
as lines with optional coloring. For 2D functional data, plots surfaces
as heatmaps with contour lines.
}
\details{
This function displays the plot immediately. To get the ggplot object
without displaying (e.g., for customization), use \code{\link{autoplot.fdata}}.
}
\examples{
library(ggplot2)
# Display plot immediately
fd <- fdata(matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10))
plot(fd)

# To get ggplot object without displaying, use autoplot:
p <- autoplot(fd)
}
